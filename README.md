Lime Player
===========

Lime Player is a simple podcast listener for Chrome, Chromium and Chrome OS.

It is currently in unpublished state on Chrome web store where only people with the link can access it, for those who are interested in trying it out drop me a message to my email I will send you the link.

At the moment Lime Player is at it's infancy, not a lot of functions, most functions not yet even built, it can play selected few podcasts from few selected podcasts I like to listen.

For those who are interested in trying it out, you can clone this repository and run it on Chrome by yourselves. But you won't get the extension updated automatically as the Chrome extension, you can still update your local clone of the repository to update your local extension.

**What is Lime Player**

Lime player is my daily challenge for 2016, with all these work I have I try to commit at least one improvement to the repository everyday. Although I've missed few days in between without committing.

Anyway I would love to see where this will end up by the end of 2016. If you are interested in contributing I would love to have your changes, and I'm happy you can fork this repository and make improvements on this.

Stack
======

Nothing much, basically HTML5, CSS3, jquery (which I hope to replace with pure JS if I can in furture) and Rachtiv JS, which is a Javascript MVC framework somewhat like react but works in Chrome extensions unlike react.
